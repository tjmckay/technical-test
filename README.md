So I believe I said when I applied that I didn't have any experience in Lua, additionally, I can say that prior to this, I had zero experience in TFS and OTC. 
So there was definitely some major learning that happened during this process. 
I wouldn't say I'm exactly happy with how any of my results turned out in terms of what you were specifically looking for in the test, but I am actually relatively happy with what it took to figure out to get as far as I did.

For Question 5, I first modified the spell eternal_winter, since it had a similar look to what you were looking for. 
I created some new attack areas in the spells.lua file (which I included in the repo) for the difference and that is what I show in the first video I included. 
I then attempted to make it a custom spell, called super_ice. I added the spell to the spells.xml file (I shared the line that I added to the xml file, not the whole file since there are a lot of spells in the list, I did the same for Q6 with that spell). 
When I then used my character to cast that spell, it ended up with just one tornado directly on top of the character, which I was not able to figure out why, but I included that video as well, since that did end up being my final result.

For Question 6, at first I tried the same approach as Question 5 by modifying the strong_haste spell and the swift_foot spell. 
But they weren't really right, since the character was still actually walking while moving forward. 
I then found a custom dash spell that someone had posted on the OTLand forum, which I noted in my comments, and then tried to make it duplicate the character and shade it darker as the duplicates got farther from the main character.
Unfortunately, the dash spell didn't seem to work the best, as it basically just teleported the character up, when they were facing that direction. 
I probably spent more time than I should have trying to troubleshoot this and again unfortunately, was not able to really get the spell working in the first place, let alone reproduce the trailing effect. 
I still included the code in the repo, as I think the trailing effect might have worked if the original spell had worked for me, but was not able to effectively test it and that is why there is no video of this function.

For Question 7, this was another instance of finding what I think would work in the OTLand forum, but just not exactly figuring out how to get it to implement while the game was running. 
I again started by trying to modify an existing button, the Quest Log, but could not get the moving button to display properly. 
So I searched the forum, found lots of mentions of modal windows, which I added to the script files in the server, but I think I was missing the part about actually getting them to show up in the game, what instance would cause the window to appear. 
So I have again included the code, which I think should work, but was not really able to do a test of if it actually worked as requested and again, that is why there is no video for this question.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this technical test, like I said, I'm not exactly happy with my results and not being able to provide videos, but I do believe that with more time and guidance that I would be able to accomplish what you were looking for. 
And thank you for considering me for the Software Development position, I hope these results will still give me the chance to speak with you further about the position and about the studio.

Kind regards,
Tyson
